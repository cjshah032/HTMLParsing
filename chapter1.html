                        <p>Programming languages differ by their program execution model; the most common are interpreted and compiled languages. Compilers translate source code into machine code, which a computer can run without intermediary support systems. Interpreted language code, on the other hand, requires support systems, interpreters, and the virtual environment to work.</p>
                        <p>C++ is a compiled language, which makes programs run faster than their interpreted counterparts. While C++ programs should be compiled for each platform, interpreted programs can operate <span>cross-platform</span>.</p>
